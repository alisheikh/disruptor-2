disruptor
=========

Warning: This is highly alpha - don't expect any of this to actually work yet.

Disruptor is a distributed fault-tolerant real-time computation platform. We intend to also
include a distributed file system and a distributed hash table but we are faking those for
the time being so we can get distributed computation going. If viable projects emerge that
solve these problems, we'll use them. (maybe these element become pluggable)
